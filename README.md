## About
 
ComplainHub was built as a quiz project for the Mobile Application Development course at **UET Lahore**. The idea was to make a real working app where students can register complaints against university departments, pick a priority level, and have everything stored live in Firebase — no local database, no server.
 
The app has four screens, field-level validation on every input, color-coded priority and status badges, and a detail screen that shows the full complaint with a nicely formatted date and time.

## Features
 
- **Splash Screen** — shows the app name and tagline for 2.5 seconds, then navigates to the form automatically
- **Complaint Registration Form** — collects student name, roll number, phone number, department, complaint title, category (spinner), priority (spinner), and a detailed description
- **Smart Field Validation** — every field is checked before submission with specific error messages:
  - Name must be at least 3 characters and letters only
  - Roll number must follow a valid format like `BSCS-101` or `2023-CS-70`
  - Phone number must be a valid Pakistani mobile number starting with `03` and exactly 11 digits
  - Department must be at least 2 characters
  - Complaint title must be at least 5 characters
  - Category and priority spinners must not be left on the default placeholder
  - Description must be at least 20 characters
- **Firebase Save** — on successful validation, complaint is saved to Firebase Realtime Database with a unique key and live timestamp
- **Success Feedback** — toast message shown on successful submission, form clears automatically
- **Complaint List Screen** — fetches all complaints from Firebase and shows them in a RecyclerView sorted by newest first
- **Priority Badges** — color-coded pill badges: Urgent (red), High (orange), Medium (amber), Low (green)
- **Status Badges** — Pending (red), Resolved (green)
- **Empty State** — emoji + message shown when no complaints exist yet
- **Complaint Detail Screen** — full information display with formatted date (`11 May 2026, 11:30 AM`), category, priority, and status
- **Back Navigation** — ActionBar back button works correctly on all screens

## Developer Notes
 
- `FirebaseHelper` uses `addValueEventListener` which keeps the list in sync live — if someone submits a complaint on another device, the list updates without refreshing
- Timestamps are stored as `Long` (milliseconds) and displayed as `dd MMM yyyy, hh:mm a` using `SimpleDateFormat`
- The phone validation regex `^03[0-9]{9}$` ensures exactly 11 digits starting with 03, covering all Pakistani networks (030x, 031x, 032x, 033x, 034x)
- Complaints are sorted by `timestamp` descending inside `FirebaseHelper.getAllComplaints()` before calling `onResult`
- Default complaint status is always `"Pending"` — set in the `Complaint` data class and explicitly passed on every submission
- `clearForm()` after submission also calls `editStudentName.requestFocus()` so cursor lands on the first field, ready for the next entry
